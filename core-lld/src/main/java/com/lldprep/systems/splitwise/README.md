# Splitwise

Expense splitting system demonstrating **Strategy**, **Factory**, **Observer**, and **Repository** patterns with a graph-based debt simplification algorithm.

## Features

- **Register users** and organise them into groups
- **Add expenses** with three split types: Equal, Exact, Percentage
- **Real-time balances** — O(1) lookup per user pair via in-memory balance map
- **Settle up** — record a direct payment to reduce a balance
- **Debt simplification** — greedy minimum-cash-flow algorithm reduces N debts to fewest transactions
- **Group expenses** — scoped expenses with member validation
- **Thread-safe** — per ordered-pair locks prevent concurrent expense additions from corrupting balances

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Strategy** | `SplitStrategy` → `EqualSplitStrategy`, `ExactSplitStrategy`, `PercentageSplitStrategy` | New split type = new class only. Zero changes to `Expense` or `ExpenseService`. |
| **Factory** | `SplitStrategyFactory.get(SplitType)` | Centralises strategy instantiation; callers never use `new ConcreteStrategy()` |
| **Observer** | `BalanceUpdateListener` | Decouples post-expense reactions (audit log, notifications) |
| **Repository** | `UserRepository`, `GroupRepository`, `ExpenseRepository` | In-memory stores; swappable for DB |
| **Facade** | `SplitwiseFacade` | Single entry point hiding expense, balance, and split complexity |

## Core Algorithm — Debt Simplification

Given N users with a complex web of debts, the system computes the minimum number of transactions to settle everyone using a greedy approach:

```
1. Compute net balance per user:
     net[user] = total owed to them − total they owe others

2. MaxHeap of creditors (net > 0), MinHeap of debtors (net < 0)

3. While both heaps non-empty:
     Pick largest creditor C and largest debtor D
     settlement = min(C.net, |D.net|)
     Record: D pays C `settlement`
     Reduce both by settlement; push back if non-zero

Complexity: O(n log n)
```

**Example:**
```
Before: Alice owed ₹600, Bob owes ₹300, Charlie owes ₹300
After simplification: Bob → Alice ₹300, Charlie → Alice ₹300
(2 transactions, down from however many expenses created these balances)
```

## Concurrency Model

Balance updates are the critical section. Two concurrent `addExpense` calls sharing the same user pair must not interleave.

**Approach:** One lock object per ordered user pair (consistent ordering by userId string prevents deadlock).

```java
// Lock key always uses lexicographically smaller userId first
String lockKey = userA.compareTo(userB) < 0 ? userA + ":" + userB : userB + ":" + userA;
synchronized(lockMap.computeIfAbsent(lockKey, k -> new Object())) {
    balances.get(debtor).merge(creditor, amount, BigDecimal::add);
}
```

**Why not lock the whole balance map?** That would serialise all expense additions across all user pairs — Alice adding an expense with Bob would block Charlie adding an expense with Dave, even though they share no state.

## Demo Scenarios

1. **Equal split** — ₹900 dinner split 3 ways → ₹300 each
2. **Exact split** — ₹5000 hotel, Alice pays ₹2000, Bob pays ₹3000
3. **Percentage split** — ₹800 cab, 60% Alice, 40% Bob
4. **Balance summary** — Alice sees she is owed ₹300 by Bob and owes ₹200 to Charlie
5. **Settle up** — Bob pays Alice ₹300 → balance zeroes
6. **Group expense** — member validation: cannot add non-member to group expense
7. **Simplify debts** — 5-person group reduced from 8 transactions to 4
8. **Concurrent expense addition** — two threads add expenses involving same pair → balances correct

## Extending the System

| Curveball | Extension |
|-----------|----------|
| Ratio split (2:3:5) | New `RatioSplitStrategy implements SplitStrategy` — zero other changes |
| Multi-currency | `CurrencyConversionStrategy`; `Expense` gains `Currency` field |
| Notifications | `BalanceUpdateListener` implementations (email, push) |
| Expense categories | `Category` enum on `Expense`; new query on `ExpenseRepository` |
| Recurring expenses | `RecurringExpenseScheduler` wraps `addExpense` on a timer |
